Developed a robust banking application with a well-architected RESTful API using Spring and MySQL for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
Implemented clear and efficient endpoints for managing banking attributes. Used Spring Framework to handle the application's core functionalities, and MySQL for persistent data storage. 
This architecture ensures seamless communication between the client and server, allowing for the smooth execution of banking operations through the defined RESTful endpoints.
